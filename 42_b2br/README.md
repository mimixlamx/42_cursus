## Project description
debain vs rocky : debian is the easyest way to start learning vm on linux.
have a massive communauty a lots of documentation and it is stable.
rocky is less beginers oriented its more ffor pro serv or enterprise.
more strict but this is olso why it is better in a admin system way.

AppArmor vs SELinux : apparmor is simple to use ffor beginers but less secure.
selinux is way more secure but quite hqrd to understand again it is for pro.
natively ok on rocky but not in debian and its the same for the other case.

UFW vs firewalld : again UFW is way easyer to use and understand.
firewalld will mostly be use with pro servers for enterprise in rocky.
UFW is quite short in command compare to firewalld whitch is more powerfull.

virtualBox vs UTM : virtualBox is used on windows as UTM is usend on mac.
virtualBox has a bigger comunity and documentaion than UTM.
